/**
 * typedIncludes
 *
 * Let's you work with a typed array (const, enum keys, etc) and assert whether
 * a variable is a member. Not only does this improve type safety, but you don't
 * get the error that "string" isn't a member of TYPE
 *
 * @example
 * const colors = ["blue", "green", "red"] as const;
 *
 * if(typedIncludes(colors, myColor)) {
 *     // typeof myColor = "blue" | "green" | "red"
 * }
 *
 * Adapted from: https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/26255#issuecomment-736971438
